# Beetle Memory Game

<b>Beetle Memory Game</b> is a game to click all beetles in a row before clicking the same one twice. 

## <b>How To Use</b>

[Open the application.]()

Click on a beetle. After successfully clicking a not previously clicked beetle, the images will be shuffled. Your current score and high score are displayed on top. There are only eight beetles so it shouldn't be too challenging, but the images are fairly similar so don't get too confused.

This application was created using React.
